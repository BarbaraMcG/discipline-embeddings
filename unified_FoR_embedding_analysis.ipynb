We use Cosine similarity as a measure of proximity between FoR embeddings, and we analyze how the overall similarity and neighbourhood of FoRs change over time.\n","\n","The notebook covers the following analysis:\n","1. **Topic similarity change over time** - For each year, pairwise Cosine similarity is computed for topic embeddings, and the average similarity is aggegated at different levels: overall, area, cluster, and level 1.\n","\n","2. **Topic neighbourhood size change over time** - For each year, neighbourhood size is computed for each topic, and the average size is aggregated at different levels: overall, area, cluster, and level 1.\n","\n","3. **Top and bottom topics with neighbourhood size**\n","\n","4. **Top and bottom topics with neighbourhood size change** - The topics with the most & least neighbourhood size change from initial year to reference year are retreived.\n","\n","5. **Top and bottom topics with neighbourhood profile change** - The profile change is computed based how the neighbours ordering of each topic changed.\n","\n","6. **Top and bottom topics with self-similarity change across time** - The topic embeddings in the intial and reference years are aligned, and self-similarity for each topic between initial and reference year is computed. \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kBEh4Q7SAW1C"},"source":["##
